# dir

This is a tiny script I use to display the contents of a directory in my terminal in a fashion similar to MS-DOS's `dir`, which
I like better than the usual `ls`.

The code isn't good, I coded it in a rush once and never worked to improve it. But it works. Use `--help` for help. Use `-s` to
display the directory listing with file and directory sizes. Use `-h` to show hidden files. Use `dir <directory>` to list the contents of other directory. Otherwise just use `dir` to list the contents of the working directory.

## How to install

Place the file in a directory in your `$PATH` and `chmod +x` it. You are ready to go, although you need Python 3 to use it.
